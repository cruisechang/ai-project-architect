# APA Catalog Skill

Use this skill when the user wants a complete overview of the repository's available `apa-*` skills.

## Goal

Read every skill under `skills/` and present:
- the skill name
- when to use it
- what it does
- how to use it in practice

## Inputs

- The current repository `skills/` directory
- Any user filter such as "all skills", "only testing skills", or "compare two skills"

## Steps

1. List all directories under `skills/`
2. Open each `SKILL.md`
3. Extract the core fields:
   - skill name
   - use case
   - main capability
   - required inputs
   - expected outputs
4. Summarize each skill in a consistent format
5. If the user asked for "all skills", include every skill in the repo
6. If the user asked for a subset, include only the requested skills
7. Keep the summary grounded in the actual `SKILL.md` content; do not invent missing behavior

## Output Format

For each skill, provide:

- `Name`: skill directory name
- `Use when`: the situation where this skill should be selected
- `Function`: the main job the skill performs
- `How to use`: a short practical instruction for invoking or applying it

## Rules

- Read all relevant `SKILL.md` files before summarizing
- Prefer concise, comparable summaries
- If two skills overlap, explain the difference briefly
- If a skill is incomplete or vague, say that explicitly

## Example Requests

- "List all repo skills"
- "Explain every skill in this repo"
- "What does each skill do?"
- "Show me how to use all available skills"
